## EVALUATION

How do you evaluate a model?



What’s the trade-off between bias and variance?



How do you estimate performance on unseen data?



You have built several different models. How would you select the best one?



What is sensitivity analysis? Is it better to have low sensitivity and low predictive power?



How do you perform good cross-validation?



What is the difference between holding out a validation set and doing 10-Fold CV?




What do you think about the idea of injecting noise in your data set to test the sensitivity of your models?



Which is better: Too many false positives or too many false negatives?



How do you ensure you’re not overfitting with a model?



Explain what resampling methods are and why they are useful. Also explain their limitations.
