## Data exploration

How do you summarize the distribution of your data?



How do you handle outliers or data points that skew data?



What assumptions can you make? Why and when? (i.e When is it safe to assume "normal")


How to efficiently represent 5 dimension in a chart or in a video?



How would you handle an imbalanced dataset?



How do you handle missing or corrupted data in a dataset?



## Feature selection

How do you select features?



What are some good ways for performing feature selection that do not involve exhaustive search?



How to apply Machine Learning to audio data, images, texts, graphs, etc?



What to do with categorical variables of high cardinality?



Can a feature that doesnt help alone, be useful when another feature is added?




## Regularization

What is Regularization?



Which problem does Regularization tries to solve?



What is the difference in the outcome (coefficients) between the L1 and L2 norms? (usually I ask them to draw the geometric shape of the functions, just to make sure)



Why (geometrically) does LASSO produce solutions with zero-valued coefficients (as opposed to ridge)?




Let us go through the derivation of OLS or Logistic Regression. What happens when we add L2L2 regularization? How do the derivations change? What if we replace L2L2 regularization with L1L1 regularization?




## Fitting

What is the Gradient Descent Method (the intuition is mostly enough)?



Does the Gradient Descent method always converge to the same point?



Is it necessary that the Gradient Descent Method will always find the global minima?



How maximum likelihood works?



Whats the difference between convex vs nonconvex?



Is it always bad to have local optima?



Whats EM?



How do you tune hyperparameters? Any method beyond grid search?



How Monte Carlo can be used for fitting?
