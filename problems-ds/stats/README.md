## Tests

- t-test
- chi-square test
- correlation

## Sampling

Why and when?
How do you calculate needed sample size? [Power analysis is advanced]
Limitations
Bootstrapping and resampling?

## Inference

*  What is a P-Value ?
*  How confidence intervals are constructed
*  Why you standardize
*  How to interpret

## Experimental design

How do test new concepts or hypotheses in....insert domain X? i.e. How would evaluate whether or not consumers like the webpage redesign or new food being served?
How do you create test and control groups?
How do you control for external factors?
How do you evaluate results?




The x and y are two random variables and their standard errors are known. How can you calculate/estimate the standard error in f(x,y)? If you want, specifically, in f(x,y) = y/x. How would you do this if you had all the data (x_i, y_i)?



Why should the test and the control group be of the same size in an "A/B" test?
