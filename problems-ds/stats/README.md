## Inference

What is a P-Value ?



How confidence intervals are constructed



Why you standardize



How to interpret




What is tt-Test/FF-Test/ANOVA? When to use it?



How would you test if two populations have the same mean? What if you have 3 or 4 populations?




You applied ANOVA and it says that the means are different. How do you identify the populations where the differences are significant?




What is the distribution of p-value’s, in general?




## Some special statistics

Chi-square test



Pearson vs spearman correlation



## Data shape

Explaing power transforms



What is Box-Cox transformation? 



How would you turn unstructured data into structured data?


Give examples of data that does not have a Gaussian distribution, or log-normal. Also give examples of data that has a very chaotic distribution?



How to check if a distribution is close to Normal? Why would you want to check it? What is a QQ Plot?


Do you know the Dirichlet distribution? the multinomial distribution? binomial? poisson?



## Experimental design

How would evaluate whether or not consumers like the webpage redesign or new food being served?



How do you create test and control groups?



How do you control for external factors?



How do you evaluate results?



Why should the test and the control group be of the same size in an "A/B" test?



Why is randomization important in experimental design?



How can you prove that one improvement you’ve brought to an algorithm is really an improvement over not doing anything? How familiar are you with A/B testing?




How to identify a cause Vs a correlation? Give examples.
