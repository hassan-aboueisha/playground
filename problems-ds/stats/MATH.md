## Algebra
- What is an eigenvalue? 
- What is Box-Cox transformation? 

## Matrix Factorization 
- pca, when do you use it? how are the components ordered?
- read up on how factorization was used in netflix competition
- i've never been asked about factor analysis, but it is great to know and makes other related questions easier

## PCA

What is Principal Component Analysis (PCA)? Under what conditions is PCA effective? How is it related to eigenvalue decomposition (EVD)?
What are the differences between Factor Analysis and Principal Component Analysis?
How will you use SVD to perform PCA? When SVD is better than EVD for PCA?
Why do we need to center data for PCA and what can happen if we donâ€™t do it?
Do we need to normalize data for PCA? Why?
Is PCA a linear model or not? Why?

## Probability

*  What is the probability to get the sum 2 if I have 2 equally weighted dice? Now with 4? 7?
*  Whats a join, conditional and a marginal distribution?
*  I usually ask a question for evaluation familiarity with Bayes Law ("I have two Coins..")

How do you compare probabilities?
Probability space is often referred to as a "vector space", is it?
Define addition on this space?
Is ds^2 = dp^2 a good metric on probability space?
How would you construct a metric on probability space, so you can start doing complicated things like L2 norm etc.?
