## Regression

What are the principal choices involved?



What is linear about linear regression?



Interpretation of coefficients



Interaction coefficients



Know how factor variables are dummy coded, coefficient interpretation



Linear regression assumptions



Residual analysis



Adding non-linear terms



Difference between L1 and L2 penalization, when you would use each one



How to deal with highly correlated variables



Walk me through how you would approach building a regression model to predict Y given you have data X
- how do you choose the right number of predictors



What are the constraints you need to keep in mind when using a linear regression?



How does the variance of the error term change with the number of predictors, in OLS?



In linear regression, under what condition R^2 always equals a perfect 1?



--------
What is Ordinary Least Squares Regression? How it can be learned?
Can you derive the OLS Regression formula? (For one-step solution)
Is model Y∼X1+X2+X1X2Y∼X1+X2+X1X2 still linear? Why?
Do we always need the intercept term? When do we need it and when do we not?
What is collinearity and what to do with it? How to remove multicollinearity?
What if the design matrix is not full rank?
What is overfitting a regression model? What are ways to avoid it?
What is Ridge Regression? How is it different from OLS Regression? Why do we need it?
What is Lasso regression? How is it different from OLS and Ridge?

What are the assumptions required for linear regression?
What if some of these assumptions are violated?
Significant features in Regression

You would like to find significant features. How would you do that?
You fit a multiple regression to examine the effect of a particular feature. The feature comes back insignificant, but you believe it is significant. Why can it happen?
Your model considers the feature XX significant, and ZZ is not, but you expected the opposite result. Why can it happen?
Evaluation

How to check is the regression model fits the data well?
