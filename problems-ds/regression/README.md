## Regression

- interpretation of coefficients
- interaction coefficients
- know how factor variables are dummy coded, coefficient interpretation
- linear regression assumptions
- residual analysis
- adding non-linear terms
- difference between L1 and L2 penalization, when you would use each one
- how to deal with highly correlated variables
- walk me through how you would approach building a regression model to predict Y given you have data X
- how do you choose the right number of predictors

*  How you can fit non-linear relations between X (say, Age) and Y (say, Income) into a Linear Model? - I also expect candidates to show me mathematically the marginal effect of X on Y based on their proposed solution.

## Time Series

- p,d,q parameters and how you choose them
- unit root and box test
- if you have a data-set with 100 observations for each Xi, and 3 lag-effect variables of X1, how many predictions will you have if you will run any simple linear regression?
