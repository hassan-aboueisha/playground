## GLM

Why do we need/want the bias term?



Why do we call it GLM when it's clearly non-linear? (somewhat tricky question, to be asked somewhat humorously---but extremely revealing.)



How you can fit non-linear relations between X (say, Age) and Y (say, Income) into a Linear Model? - I also expect candidates to show me mathematically the marginal effect of X on Y based on their proposed solution.




## Time Series

p,d,q parameters and how you choose them



unit root and box test



if you have a data-set with 100 observations for each Xi, and 3 lag-effect variables of X1, how many predictions will you have if you will run any simple linear regression?
