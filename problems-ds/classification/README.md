Classification
==============

## Overview

What are the differences between RF, SVM, NB, NN and LR?


How to evaluate a classifier?



Whatâ€™s the difference between a generative and discriminative model?

## Decision trees

How is a decision tree pruned?



What is a decision tree?



What are some business reasons you might want to use a decision tree model?



How do you build it? What impurity measures do you know?



Describe some of the different splitting rules used by different decision tree algorithms.



Is a big brushy tree always good? Why would you want to prune it?



Is it a good idea to combine multiple trees?



What is Random Forest? Why is it good?



Other ways to combine trees? What about boosting?




## Random Forest

How a tree is grown



Purpose of growing a forrest



Purpose of selecting a subset of variables at each split



How pruning works



How variable importance works



Knowing gbm here is also a plus


On what type of ensemble technique is a random forest based? What particular limitation does it try to address?


## SVM

What is the maximal margin classifier? How this margin can be achieved and why is it beneficial?



How do we train SVM? What about hard SVM and soft SVM?



What is a kernel? Explain the Kernel trick



Which kernels do you know? How to choose a kernel?



## Logistic regression

Explain Logistic Regression to an economist, biologist or physical scientist. You can use the "formula" if you want. Motivate the "formula".



What does the score distribution for logistic regression look like? How would I track it?



How should logistic regression scores be calibrated? What are the dangers of over-fitting in calibration?



## Neural Networks

What is an Artificial Neural Network?



How to train an ANN? What is back propagation?



How does a neural network with three layers (one input layer, one inner layer and one output layer) compare to a logistic regression?



What is deep learning? What is CNN (Convolution Neural Network) or RNN (Recurrent Neural Network)?
