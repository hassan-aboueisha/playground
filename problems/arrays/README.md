- Find the most frequent integer in an array
- Write fibbonaci iteratively and recursively (bonus: use dynamic programming)
- Find pairs in an integer array whose sum is equal to 10 (bonus: do it in linear time)
- Given 2 integer arrays, determine of the 2nd array is a rotated version of the 1st array. Ex. Original Array A={1,2,3,5,6,7,8} Rotated Array B={5,6,7,8,1,2,3}
- Find the only element in an array that only occurs once
- Find the common elements of 2 int arrays
- Implement binary search of a sorted array of integers
- Implement binary search in a rotated array (ex. {5,6,7,8,1,2,3})
- Merge sorted Array B into sorted Array A
