For aspiring data scientists: Why do you want a career in data science?



Have you taken any data-science-related online courses? If yes, how many did you complete with a certificate?



Have you participated in any data science challenges? If yes, can you describe one of them?



What is the biggest data set that you have processed and how did you process it? What was the result?



Tell me two success stories about your analytic or computer science projects? How was the lift (or success) measured?
