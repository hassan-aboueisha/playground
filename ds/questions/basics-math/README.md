General
------

How do you assess the statistical significance of an insight?:

Provide a simple example of how an experimental design can help answer a question about behavior. How does experimental data contrast with observational data?:

Explain likely differences between administrative datasets and datasets gathered from experimental studies. What are likely problems encountered with administrative data? How do experimental methods help alleviate these problems? What problem do they bring?:


Experimental design
-------

How do you create test and control groups?:

How do you control for external factors?:

How do you evaluate results?:

Why should the test and the control group be of the same size in an "A/B" test?:

Why is randomization important in experimental design?:

How can you prove that one improvement youâ€™ve brought to an algorithm is really an improvement over not doing anything? How familiar are you with A/B testing?:

How do you decide which test to use?:

How to identify a cause Vs a correlation? Give examples.:

What are confounding variables?:


Sampling
------

What is statistical power?:

Explain selection bias (with regard to a dataset, not variable selection). Why is it important? How can data management procedures such as missing data handling make it worse?:

How do you calculate needed sample size?:

How do you control for biases?:

When you sample, what bias are you inflicting?:

Some 3rd party organization randomly assigned people to control and experiment groups. How can you verify that the assignment truly was random?:

Methods for sampling? Why they are useful? What are their limitations?:


Sample Estimates
------

What is the Central Limit Theorem? Explain it. Why is it important?:

How to estimate mean/deviation/variance of population from a sample?:


Hypothesis testing
------

What is a P-Value? How they are distributed?:

How confidence intervals are constructed:

What are the tt, ff, chi and anova tests? When to use it?:

You applied ANOVA and it says that the means are different. How do you identify the populations where the differences are significant?:

How would you test if two populations have the same mean? What if you have 3 or 4 populations?:

Give an example where the median is a better measure than the mean:

How to use resampling for hypothesis testing? Have you heard of Permutation Tests?:


Probbility
-------

What is the Law of Large Numbers?:

Explain what a long-tailed distribution is and provide three examples of relevant phenomena that have long tails. Why are they important in classification and regression problems?:

Give examples of data that does not have a Gaussian distribution, nor log-normal.:

How would you construct a metric on probability space, so you can start doing complicated things like L2 norm etc.?:


Bayes
-----

Whats a join, conditional and a marginal distribution?:

Whats bayes analysis?:  

Whats a conjugate distribution?:
